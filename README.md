Premier Soccer Leaderboard Tracker

Our website, created by William Ly, Sheryas Rai, Joseph Ismael, and Alex Kim, focuses on accessibility and the simplicity of making a tracker for intramural soccer leagues. 

Resources Used:

  Python
  Django
  Javascript
  Bootstrap
  Git
  VSCode
  Repl
  Discord

Group Interest and Goals:

We firstly wanted a project that was interesting and not made just for the sake of a hackathon. Our project has ample room to grow and have numerous features that can be added later on. 

Our group had the collective idea of making a product that can make direct impact with our community. In our case, we decided to make an application that can be used by athletes of any kind and students of any kind. In later stages, we plan to make it more personalized with themes relating to UMass Amherst. Sports and intramurals especially are important to the group of student body at any college and it certainly is present at UMass Amherst. With the resources provided by the Hackathon at UMass and the collective interest, the final product of the hack resulted in a shape of a league tracker. 


Idea Development:

Our group had numerous ideas and had countless discussions on what to narrow our projects down to. Our ideas started with public restrooms APIs or apps that interacted with the map API. However, we decided to make an application fitting to especially those around our age such as college students. With sports interest, and further interest in bringing communities together, we realized a league tracker can fulfil the best of both worlds. 

The Hacking Process/Collaboration: 

The hackathon we participated in was Hackathon UMass VIII. This is the first ever virtual hackathon and communication was certainly a large obstacle when it came to collaboration. We had issues of time differences as this is the first time all of the contributors really met and we did so in a virtual environment. With 2 of our developers in the west coast and the other 2 being from the east coast, it certainly brought up some time constraints. 

Our collaboration was mainly through the virtual communication tool Discord and all coding communication happened with github and the utilization of git. The toughest part about this process was that being in a virtual environment made it difficult to show our products or our thought processes. We had to use our communication skills and well explained thought processes to truly bring the most of the project. 


Planned Addition to Project:

Before reading further on this section, we plan to add sophisticated details to bring further ease to our user experience. 
Examples are: 

  Possession Statistics
  Custom Fantasy Soccer Feature
  Easier modification of scores
  User roles (Captain, leader, etc)
  Entrance Fee Capabilities
  Custom Sports
  Custom Scoring


Contributions/Feedbacks:

We welcome any criticism, any form of feedback for further improvements. If the project is something you would like to take part of, please reach out to one of our contributors! 

Summary: 

We would like to thank UMass Amherst for hosting this hackathon and all the staff and sponsors for providing us with great workshops to help us further our knowledge in the software world. We have great hopes for this project and we are excited to see what's to come of our work. 

Before concluding, we would like to mention that with recent troubled times, we would like to all push a unifying message that especially in the software industry, we all stand to support all genders, race, ethnicity, religion. We ask for everyone to join us in getting this important message across. 

With also the periods of holidays and isolation for many, we would like to push the support of mental health and its awareness. Our contributors and hackers around you will love to lend an ear to listen or just comfort anyone that is struggling with mental health.

Thank you for reading and I hope you are excited as we are seeing what's to come of the project!
